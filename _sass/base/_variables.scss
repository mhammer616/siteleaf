    COLORS
    
    IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE A GENERIC NAMING SYSTEM FOR COLORS USED THROUGHOUT THE 
    SITE. THIS ALLOWS US TO BUILD UPDATE VARIABLES IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT HAVING 
    POTENTIAL ISSUES LIKE RED BECOMING GREEN DUE TO A RE-BRAND.

    Primary, Seoncdary, and Tertiary refer to the most used, second most used
    and third most used color in the pallete.  These are generally shades of
    gray used to set the color of copy and backgrounds of elements.

    Aceent colors are used to set the brand colors used throughout the web 
    design. These are commonly used to accent an element like when used as a 
    border or design element to a heading, or draw the users attention to a
    call to action like a button.

    The reason we want to stick to this style naming convention for colors
    is so that if the branding of the company changes, we can quickly update
    a variable from a light shade of green to a WCAG compliant shade of green
    and not have to do a find and replace for $lt-green and change it to 
    $dk-green.

    FONT SETTINGS

    These variables define the font settings used throughout the website.

    Setting the copies font family, size, color and line-height allows us to 
    use these variables throughout our files and ensure we are consistently
    setting things up.  These are all used in the reset file on the body and 
    html element, which should mean the only time you need to re-use these
    are when you are resetting a more specific class back to these values.

    The headings file under structure utilize the heading variables.

\*  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  */
$copyFF: 'Lato', Helvetica, sans-serif; // FONT FAMILY FOR DEFAULT COPY
$copyFS: 1.6rem;
$copyLH: 1.5;

    GUTTER

    This is probably the most used set of variables found throuhgout the base 
    styling of the component library.

    Utilizing a standard set of gutters for spacing will help maintain 
    consistency throughout the website. Most of our designers use at least 3
    common sizes for gutters in their designs.

    We utilize the Normal, Small and Large gutters to create the spacing for
    all of our components that have sm and lg variations.  The core styling
    utilizes the $gutter variable, while the sm and lg utilize $gutterSm
    and $gutterLg respectively.

\*  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  */
$gutter: 4rem; // GLOBALLY USED SPACING VARIABLE EQUAL TO THE GUTTER BETWEEN COLUMNS
$gutterSm: ($gutter / 2);
$gutterLg: ($gutter * 2);
$gutterXl: ($gutter * 4);
$gutterXxl: ($gutter * 8);
